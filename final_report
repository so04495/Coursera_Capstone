Intro/Business Problem:
In which areas are restaurants of each brand concentrated the most? There is a chance that houses in the area can affect what kind of restaurants exist.
Institutional buildings can also influence the concentration. The terrain and climate can also influence the concentration. Some businesses might not
even be near each other for competitive reasons. The purpose of this question is to figure out the location for the most optimal restaurant placement,
in terms of money and stock transportation.

Data:
I believe New York City will be a good starting location. The data I will be needing are coordinates of the individual restaurants, however many I
could collect, and their respective names. I also need information, perhaps more coordinates, regarding the city infrastructure in relation to the
restaurant locations. The source of my data is some standard set provided by IBM.

Methodology:
Used Folium to map out the various points. Unfortunately, viewers will have to assume that the circle markers based on the data are restaurants, not some
other thing. The entirety of New York is mapped out, and the algorithm is supposed to choose a spot relative to the density of the points.

Results:
The best areas to establish a restaurant business is the large empty spot in Staten Island and the largely populated areas of mainland New York.

Discussion:
The map is looking kinda bad. Someone should really compile data regarding restaurants.

Conclusion:
There is a severe lack of data regarding restaurants. In other words, there is nothing to collect, and a bunch more to create. It is an endeavor I am
unwilling to suffer because the reward is too small. I am forced to do a lot of guesswork using a program that can't even tell what the markers indicate in detail.
